<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> You there! I know you! What are you doing here?
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Who, me? How do you know me?
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> Yeees… I see something is different with you… you glow with energy like a Willow Wisp under a moon-eclipsed night sky!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> But I am no Wisp! I don’t know you!
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> Oh, but I know you… you’ve been here before…
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> You possess the energy of this place. But there is something more, still…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> I don’t recognise this place.
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> I sense evil in you… you have done evil deeds… I’ve witnessed it…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Me? What is this evil? I am just a tiny bug!
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> It is not who you are now, it is who you are when you are not as you are now.
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Wha… what?
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> You have committed evil against the forest using your human body.
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> Luck for you that you aren’t in your body currently.
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> So terrible! So exciting! I have a human body! How do you know all this?
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> We are the Forest Spirits.
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> We guard the forest to maintain the delicate balance for harmony to exist.
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> The balance has been disrupted lately… You see, the incident… it has changed us…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> What happened?
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> A most terrible thing! The Ancestor was cut! Oh, what a loss…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Oh no!
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> You… really don’t know?
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> I know that I am a butterfly and I like to explore!
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> Hmm… I see a potential for redemption… with your current form.
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> …
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> Please, I beg you…! Look for the Sacred Grove. You will find redemption there!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> An assignment! A reason! I shall go! How exciting!
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> Then go, in peace. But move quickly, as the humans are approaching…
<b><color=#259E00>Forest Spirit:</color></b> We cannot stay here for too long, lest we get caught!
