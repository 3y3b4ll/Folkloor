<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> Well hello! Who do I see with my eyes! Are you a ghost or a human?
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Me? I am… I a-am… I don’t know who I am! But who am I?
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> My old eyes say that you are a butterfly, but not only… there is something more. You seem… incomplete.
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Incomplete? But I am whole! See?
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> Ah, yes, I see… You are missing your body!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> But I have my body, I am a butterfly!
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> No, yes… I mean… Your physical body!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Physical? What do you mean?
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> A human body!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Huu-man? What is that? Is it a herb?
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> Human! It is a dangerous being! A powerful creature that runs fast on its hind legs and speaks in tongues. Very dangerous for small animals like me, and you too!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> I don’t understand… a danger to myself?
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> No, no… you are in your physical form, but you aren’t now.
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Confusing… I am here and I am not me. Is this a riddle?
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> No! It is a warning, my friend… beware of the humans!
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> You will surely see it soon for yourself.
<b><color=#834F16>Hedgehog:</color></b> Go now! I’ve business to take care of, since… Oh, well, bye!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Thanks, Hedgehog!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Oh roar, better explore some more!
