The Butterfly won and was pulled back into the human body.

Nature fell silent. The man stood. But something was wrong: The hands were cold, the gaze unseeing. The man spoke but not in his own voice. The spirit of Hiiepuu had entered the body as well and now stirred within. The eyes became glowing blue, the ground beneath his steps grew cold and metallic. The Sacred Grove started emitting an electric blue light. The human had returned, but the soul was crushed. The resulting existence - bleak and unfeeling.

To master nature is to become part of it. To win over nature is to lose what made you human. Such was the necessary sacrifice.
