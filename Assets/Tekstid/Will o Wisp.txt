<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> You there! Your body - where is it?! Who are you?
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Tee-hee, you tell me!
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> You… you puny lost soul! I will put you into the boglake which you defiled…
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> ...but without your body it is pointless. Where is your body, tell me now!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> What body? I am here!
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> Hmm… are you sure it is your real body?
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> I don’t know anything about any bodies!
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> I see… you’ve lost your body and cannot return. You poor lost soul…
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> What is the first thing you remember?
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> I remember… flying upwards… and a meadow…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Then frosty footprints! Do humans make these?
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> It was no human, indeed Coldsnap instead!
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> …
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> Wait! Did Coldsnap’s prints lead you here?
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Well… yes, I’ve been stumbling and exploring, happening upon the prints every now and then.
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> Oh no, no-no-no…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> What is this Cold-snap? Is it a flower?
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> You naive thing… if you don’t wise up you’ll end up in Toonela!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Toon-elaa, how do I get there?
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> Just like how you are right now - floating around aimlessly without a body!
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> …
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> I strongly suggest you find your body this instant! And come back here with it…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> But how to find my body…? I heard something about a Sacred Grove.
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> Ah yes, I now see… everything.
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> The Forest Spirit told me to fly to the Sacred Grove. Where is it?
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> Yes, good idea! Traverse the Bog to reach the mid-boglake island.
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> On the island is the Sacred Grove.
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> There the veil is thinnest between the Natural and the Supernatural realms.
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> There you will recognize your human… and possibly find redemption!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Redeem-emption, sounds tasty! Is it a fruit?
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> No more questions! Now go, complete your destiny!
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> My destiny! Whee!
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> *mumbles* What a simpleton… yet from a noble kind…
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> Huh?
<b><color=#5D3AC5>Will o' Wisp:</color></b> *ignores the Butterfly completely*
<b><color=#FF407D>Butterfly:</color></b> On I fly, finale is nigh!
