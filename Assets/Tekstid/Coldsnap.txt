<color=#FF407D><b>Butterfly:</b></color> It’s the most sacred Hiiepuu! But it appears… tired?
<color=#FF407D><b>Butterfly:</b></color> You… led me here? Who are you?
<color=#1288E9><b>Coldsnap:</b></color> Not here. Below. The tree called, and I answered.
<color=#FF407D><b>Butterfly:</b></color> The tree? It looks tired! Is it sleeping?
<color=#1288E9><b>Coldsnap:</b></color> ...
<color=#FF407D><b>Butterfly:</b></color> This odd shadow on the ground… looks familiar. I feel a pull towards it.
<color=#1288E9><b>Coldsnap:</b></color> You don’t recognise your body?
<color=#FF407D><b>Butterfly:</b></color> But I am me!
<color=#1288E9><b>Coldsnap:</b></color> You are just a lost soul. A lost soul doesn’t need a body anyway.
<color=#1288E9><b>Coldsnap:</b></color> The roots take the warm. The cold gives it form.
<color=#FF407D><b>Butterfly:</b></color> It is… me! I am starting to remember! I must return to my body!
<color=#1288E9><b>Coldsnap:</b></color> Excellent…
