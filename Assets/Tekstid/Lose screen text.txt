The human body slipped from its owner’s grasp and was drawn beneath the fallen tree.

The Butterfly hovered above, weightless, untethered, watching as the Hiiepuu began to breathe again. Its roots stirred. The bark closed like healing flesh. The Butterfly looked down and understood it had no physical body any more, and was swallowed by the Hiiepuu which was growing towards the sky once more. On the bark, faint markings appeared—wings, frozen in mid-beat. From that silence, it became the Grove’s keeper, a drifting eye of light among the branches, warning away all who would harm the tree again.

The forest never wanted restoration, only equilibrium. And such was the sacrifice needed to repay nature.
